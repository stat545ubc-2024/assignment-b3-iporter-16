# Cheese of the World

### A shiny app for discovering new cheeses, every day.

This shiny app is deployed and ready for cheese-lovers' use right [here](https://iporter-ubc.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-iporter-16/).

The **Cheese of the World** app utilises the cheese dataset published on [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-06-04/readme.md), originally sourced from [cheese.com](cheese.com). These data include hundreds of different cheeses of many countries, milks, and eating experiences,

With my shiny app, you can filter by your dietary preferences and explore what flavours and colours of cheese are available to you! Not only restricted to simple cow or plant-based milk, you can now discover unique cheese colours afforded to you by expanding your palate to goat, buffalo, and even camel milk.
